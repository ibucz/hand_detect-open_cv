# hand_detect-open_cv
This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PySerial to detect hand gestures through a webcam and send corresponding commands to an Arduino via serial communication. The Arduino can then perform actions such as displaying messages on an LCD, turning on LEDs, controlling motors, or any other hardware interaction you define.
